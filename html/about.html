			<div><p>I'm Arta Mjeku. I live in Prishtina where I currently am a second-year Computer Science and Engineering (BSc) student at UBT. I am a big tech-enthusiast and an aspiring UI/UX designer as well as an aspiring software engineer. <br> Although I am only a second-year CSE student, I am a very passionate person who is interested in gaining new skills that help me advance in my career path and industry. I consider myself to be a very responsible person, dedicated to finishing given tasks in time, a great team-player and a great problem-solver. I enjoy working in group projects as there is great room for improvement by helping each other out. My experience in UX is closely related to working with Adobe XD. In the past, I've worked on a few websites through university projects (such as VisitKosovo), (iRead) and as well as contributed to the Open Contracts platform managed by Open Data Kosovo through Techstitution. </p> </div>
